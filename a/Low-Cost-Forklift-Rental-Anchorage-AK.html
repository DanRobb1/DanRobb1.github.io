<h2>Safety With Forklifts Anchorage </h2>
<p>We offer our customers access to both Factory New as well as Pre-Owned forklift trucks. At Granite Industrial Trucks we are ready to meet the needs of your company today. Whether you need a compact electric lift truck for your narrow aisles, a big boy 110,000 lb. lift for your quarry operation or anything in between, you can count on Altorfer Cat.

We are a well-known manufacturer, exporter, wholesaler, distributor and supplier of Full Electric Pallet Truck, which is an efficient performing product of our company. A significant portion of my business deals with forklift operator training (or more precisely, powered industrial truck operator training).</p>
<p>We provide good condition usedforklift. All of our rough terrain forklifts incorporate designs & features that make our products stand out from the competition. Industrial trucks can lift and lower thousands of pounds of goods on the lifting mechanism attached to them. The 56 hp version feels underwhelming compared to some other forklifts such as the Caterpillar.</p>

<p>Class 3: Electric Motor Hand or Hand-Rider Trucks. Using the add-a-leaf will increase the height, but sometimes makes the suspension ride rough because of the added spring rate. Rough terrain forklifts are perfect for moving heavy loads across rugged terrains. Also known as stand-on and electric riders, standup trucks are easier to maneuver than sit-downs and can work in smaller spaces.</p>
<p>If you're unable to find a pre-made lifted truck in your area, or if these vehicles are too expensive for your budget, you may have more luck modifying a truck yourself. The arm allows the operator flexibility in picking up and placing loads (at various distances and lift heights) from the front of the machine. Load capacities are similar to a standard lift, ranging between 5,000 lbs and 36,000 lbs.</p>
<p>Our order pickers are available in brands you can trust such as Unicarriers, EP Equipment and Xilin and are backed by 100% after sales service and support. The dual path is perfect for that driver who carries more weight on one side of their truck than the other. Rough terrain forklifts have increased traction on the tyres for navigation over poor terrain. Always start the engine while seated in the operator's position—never while standing alongside the forklift.</p>
<p>Not all forks are designed to lift pallets. For independent movement, lifting and placement of discrete loads throughout a facility, a variety of motorized lift trucks or forklifts can be used. If your company has an accident or injury with a forklift, OSHA will investigate and request training records. These options are available on flexible, competitive priced monthly payment plans ensuring that each unique customer can structure a payment plan suitable to their budgetary needs and forklift fleet requirements.</p>
