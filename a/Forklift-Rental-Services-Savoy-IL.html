The first reason is obvious Sun Equipment does not want you to purchase the wrong used forklift for sale or spend more than you need on a used forklift with features that you will never use.

From new and used sales to fleet financing solutions to servicing and maintenance, your local Cat lift trucks and warehouse equipment dealer is ready to help when needed.

In 1962, the first telescoping-boom rough terrain forklift came on the market. Check the areas around and behind your vehicle before putting it in reverse, even if that means you need to temporarily turn the truck off, hop down out of the driver's seat and do a quick check for any children or pedestrians in the area.</p>
<p>Beyond that, many workers can also be injured when (1) lift trucks are inadvertently driven off loading docks; (2) lifts fall between docks and an unsecured trailer; (3) they are struck by a lift truck; or (4) they fall while on elevated pallets and tines. While gas forklift types do not need to charge and can operate day or night as long as they have enough fuel, battery operated forklifts need to be properly charged for up to eight hours to be used at maximum capacity.</p>

<p>At least 22% of these deaths were caused by forklift overturns and another 20% to workers on foot being struck by the forklift. In honor of National Forklift Safety Day on June 12, we present our annual ranking of the 10 (actually, 11 due to a tie for 10th place) largest global manufacturers of forklifts, as ranked by revenue. Pallet jacks can bear a lot of weight, but they also have limits that cannot be safely exceeded.</p>
<p>Whether you're looking to buy a new forklift, rent compact construction equipment, or service an existing machine, everything we do is rooted in the highest quality. But a truck with 31" tires just will not go anywhere unless it is paved and suitable for cars. When driving around in a lifted Jeep Wrangler, you are in control of a highly capable truck.

They can handle anything from small single pallet loads to 40-foot loaded containers.
