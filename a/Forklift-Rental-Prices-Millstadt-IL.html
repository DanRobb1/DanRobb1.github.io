<p>The Southeast team has years of experience managing large forklift companies, owning and operating wholesale forklift companies and turning wrenches when we need to. Consider what you will be using your forklift for and what processes you want to optimise before choosing any new machinery and training employees. Like class 1 forklifts, class 2s are also battery-powered and are more optimally used within a warehouse rather than out in the shipping yard.</p>
<p>If the operator must frequently enter and exit the forklift to access product, build pallets, etc. Ask what kind of lift it is, who installed it and if there have been any problems with it. Most lifted trucks are bought used so bring along a flash light and inspect the truck for crusted mud in the vehicle's nooks and crannies. Stand-up forklifts (also known as stand-on and electric riders) are designed for applications where the operator must get on and off the lift truck frequently.</p>
<p>They have small tires designed to run on paved surfaces and are usually powered by an internal combustion engine running on gasoline, diesel, or propane fuel. Lift Capacity: 16000 lbs. For trucks with tilting masts, the mast should be vertical as defined in Test OP1, or at full reaward tilt, whichever is less stable.

<p>13 Low lift trucks may be operated by a person seated on the machine, or by a person walking alongside, depending on the design.
