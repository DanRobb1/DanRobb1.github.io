The Industrial Duty Pallet Jack is great for small spaces, and handles easily.

This is highlighted by the impressive load capacity: Our low-level order pickers, for instance, can lift up to three pallets weighing up to 2.5 tons with their 2.4 metre long forks. The forklift training material fit our training needs nicely. They are more maneuverable and need less space to operate than sit-down forklifts.</p>

Lifted trucks look right at home on any beach, and their increased performance makes traversing sand more satisfying than an ocean breeze.
