<p>This course is designed to provide experienced operators with relevant knowledge and understanding of practical use of the Industrial Counterbalance Forklift. Gas forklifts constantly need to be refilled, so the recurring need to purchase fuel makes the long-term costs hefty. If you are a forklift operator, be sure to fasten your seat belt before moving the equipment. They're the most common type of cargo transport truck in stores, but they're also popular in warehouses and distribution centers, too. For trucks with tilting masts, the mast should be vertical or at full rearward till, whichever is less stable.</p>
<p>While they move heavy loads and increase efficiency, forklifts can also cause serious injuries when they are used unsafely. Those are the vehicles that you will need to test drive before making a decision. OSHA standard 29 CFR 1910.178 covering PITs requires employers to develop and implement a training program based on the general principles of safe truck operation.</p>

Rough terrain forklifts are perfect for moving heavy loads across rugged terrains.

A forklift truck is designed with protected cab for a driver and two prongs on the front to move and carry heavy loads around your factory or warehouse.

The mast is capable of rotating 90 degrees, and the forks can then advance like on a reach mechanism, to pick full pallets.</p>
