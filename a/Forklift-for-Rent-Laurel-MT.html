<h2>Hoist Material Handling Laurel </h2>
<p>But if the forklift is put in motion, or sits on a sloping surface, its center of gravity shifts. The North American electric truck market grew 6%, whereas the IC market was down 5%. The IC decline was almost entirely centered on Class 4, indoor cushion tire equipment, which fell 11% as Class 5 remained flat.

Operators should be trained to operate the type of trucks they work on. They should also know the potential risks for each model.

<p>With Crown's Stability Stance, operators have four points of solid contact with the lift truck when stopping and starting from 9 metres in the air.
