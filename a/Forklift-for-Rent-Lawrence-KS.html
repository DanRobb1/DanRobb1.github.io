<p>A simple phone call to Sun Equipment will initiate a discovery phone conversation where they will share their hands on knowledge of the business and guide you to the right used forklift for your needs. These trucks are great for loading and unloading pallets and balanced materials, well as removing and transporting items from delivery vehicles.

<p>Truck should be placed on an initially level test platform in a position that the center line of the truck is per-perpendicular the axis of tilting of the test platform, and with the rear wheels placed in their least stable position. The wheels on most lifted trucks are quite a bit larger than those on standard-sized trucks. More importantly, we provide every one of the products and services that you require to oversee and care for your fork lifts.</p>
<p>Additionally, if you're towing a heavy load, a lifted suspension provides the benefit of having more room to settle before the weight of the load bottoms out. For trucks with tilting masts, the mast should be vertical as defined in Test # OP1 or at full rearward tilt, whichever is less stable. The new Toyota high capacity reach forklifts are developed for intensive stacking applications focusing on productivity, reliability, ergonomics (controls, steering and seat adapted to the driver's needs) and most importantly safety.</p>
