The ability to floor-stack a product is based on the stability of the loaded pallet combined with the product's capacity to handle the weight without buckling on itself.">

<p>Although the test load must not be restrained in any manner that will affect the deflection of the forks or mast, or free movement of truck, as the platform is tilted, the test load should be secured against possible sliding on the forks in order to sustain an accurate load center and for safety reasons in case the truck tips past the balance point.</p>
<p>On completion of this conversion training, operators will have an demonstrated a robust understanding of the operational features and techniques associated to 4 way directional reach truck operations. If a lifted truck's front or rear bumper is 20 inches taller than a car bumper, we are looking at the truck's bumper clearing the car's hood and impacting the windshield.</p>
<p>These abilities made rough terrain forklifts vital on farms and construction sites. This course has been designed to introduce workers to the forklift they'll be operating, what it's capable of, learn it's limitations, and train them on how to operate it properly.
