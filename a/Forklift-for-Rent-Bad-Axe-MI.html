<h3>Forklift Operator Bad Axe MI</h3>
<p>Understanding when and why you should rent forklifts can help you to improve your bottom line. We offer flexible rent-to-own options on our Hyster and Yale forklifts, an extensive selection of new material handling equipment , and a used inventory that is updated daily. A scissor lift used forklift for sale is generally used for temporary, flexible access purposes such as maintenance and construction work or by firefighters for emergency access, which distinguishes them from permanent access equipment such as elevators.</p>
<p>A lifted truck also has a higher resale value because of how valuable these trucks are. We have used lifted trucks in stock from time-to-time, but we cannot guarantee availability on pre-owned models due to frequent changes in our inventory. As a result, customers should contact our team with questions about these suspension lift kits. The taller tires get the differential higher off the ground, reducing the risk of damage from obstacles, and all four wheels gain maximum traction due to the lifted suspension.</p>
<p>Five new forklift models - with load capacities from 1.4 - 2.5 tons - deliver class-leading performance, and lift heights up to 13 metres. Counterbalance forklift trucks are majorly preferred for use in applications where space is limited due to their effective maneuverability. A body lift increases the truck's ride height without changing the suspension, making them a good choice for light off-roading and adding a touch of style.</p>

Variable reach rough terrain forklifts were originally built for residential and commercial masonry trades. If you need to service, buy or rent a lift truck, make Altorfer Lift Truck your first call.</p>
