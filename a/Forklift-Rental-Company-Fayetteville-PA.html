Industrial counterbalance lift trucks are deadly - more than one hundred workers die and thousands are injured every year as a result of these powerful machines. Rough-terrain forklifts offer great versatility and are often called to fill a niche application.</p>
<p>Given their job description and different types of conditions to deal with, order pickers need to be OSHA compliant with their training. Short Term forklift rental solutions can help you react immediately to a situation with a predicted cost. In a changing and fluctuating market, the rough-terrain forklift and telehandler sector is not without its challenges.</p>

Trucks with suspension lifts tend to handle quite a bit different than factory models, not only due to the higher center of gravity but also because of the changes to the suspension.</p>
