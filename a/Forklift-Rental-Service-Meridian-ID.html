<p>Therefore, forklifts have been placed into several different classes. Suspension lift kits‚Äù are the other popular choice when setting up lifted trucks. Year-end forklift truck sales of 260,180 included electric rider trucks (Class 1 and Class 2 combined), motorized hand trucks (Class 3) and internal combustion powered trucks (Class 4 and Class 5 combined). Linde reach trucks are tailor-made for these conditions and ensure extremely efficient operation in high rack warehouses.</p>

A lifted truck shows that there's more to a modern pickup than just its performance and tech features.</p>
