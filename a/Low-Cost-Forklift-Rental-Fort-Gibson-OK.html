H&E were founded in 1961 and have been providing equipment rental for more than 50 years. MARCOM's Forklift Safety: Industrial Counterbalance Lift Trucks training has been designed to introduce employees to the forklift they'll be using, explain its capabilities and limitations, and show them how to operate and maintain it properly.</p>
<p>These are Sit-down forklifts designed for indoor use with solid, cushioned tires — powered by internal-combustion (IC) engines that run on diesel fuel or, more commonly, LP gas. You don't want a truck that was lifted by some random mechanic since there is no guarantee the mechanic knows what he or she is doing. Since they can easily move from indoor to exterior jobs, these machines are remarkably flexible.</p>

Theoretically this is to increase off-road performance, although the higher center of gravity would likely make them more likely to roll over on rough terrain.</p>
<p>Gas-powered forklifts offer long service lives with relatively low maintenance costs. Efficient storage is an operational focus for many warehouse and industrial space owners and forklift trucks allow a company to make the most of their vertical storage capacity.

Comparable to the height capacity of a standard forklift, the outrigger legs on the front of the machine can support the load up to more than 30 feet.
