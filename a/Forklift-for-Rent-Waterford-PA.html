<p>A truck that has had its suspension modified so that it rides way too far off the ground, usually to the point where the high center of gravity could actually be dangerous. The Pivot Steer Forklift Truck is commonly used in industry both inside of a warehouse and is ideal for very narrow aisle work as the mast can be rotated 90° to either side of the truck. It keeps some of the ride characteristics you love from the factory Jeep Wrangler spring while improving the off-road performance. We have an expansive inventory of pre-owned forklifts from Hyster, Taylor, Yale, Toyota, Caterpillar, Hoist, Kalmar, TCM and other leading brands.</p>
<p>With that much juice, the 2C5000 can lift a full payload at 125 ft per minute while an empty payload reaches 130 fpm. The best thing about rough terrain forklifts is that they allow you to work in places traditional forklifts can't go. Rugged terrain that is difficult to excavate, access or navigate doesn't need to slow your work down. Check out our range of used forklifts available for purchase.</p>

Our industrial reach forklift truck training course will provide learners with the basic knowledge and practical skills involved in safely operating an industrial reach forklift truck.</p>
<p>First forklifts appeared already in the early 20th century, and were used in World War II. Today, forklift trucks facilitate work of thousands of people, especially in manufacturing and warehousing sectors. One of the main safety risks for order pickers is falling from height when exiting the cabin onto pallets, partially enclosed platforms or racking. Our hand pallet jack import data solutions meet your actual import requirements in quality, volume, seasonality, and geography.</p>
<p>8 Finished forklifts are shipped to the customer or distributor by truck or by rail. Customization and accessories for trucks go beyond what the manufacturer offers on brand new models, however, giving truck drivers even more freedom to make their pickups their own. Forklift rentals require research and planning, and that's where the experienced team at Thompson Lift Truck can help.</p>
