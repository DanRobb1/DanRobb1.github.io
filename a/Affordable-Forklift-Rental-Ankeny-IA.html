<p>Short-term requirements - If you only use the equipment to smooth out business operations during busy months or for a limited period, buying a forklift might be too costly. If you already have one of our electric forklift trucks, it can be easily retrofitted with lithium-ion power. They are also sometimes referred to as pallet trucks, pallet pumps, and pump trucks.</p>
<p>That's why it's so important for operators to complete FLT counterbalance license training and receive their forklift operator certification.

Remember: you always want to buy a forklift that has a slightly higher load capacity than what you think you will need.
