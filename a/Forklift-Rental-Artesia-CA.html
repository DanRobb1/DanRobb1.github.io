<p>Rough terrain forklifts are reliable, versatile and easy-to-use. You must consider whether the forklift will be working indoors or outdoors, whether it will work on smooth floors or rough terrain and what lift heights and types of product or materials will be involved. Optimum performanceWe are a well-known for manufacturing, exporting, wholesaling, distributing and supplying Hand Pallet Hydraulic Truck, which is an efficient product of our company.</p>
<p>In 1958, the first four-wheel drive rough terrain forklift was introduced. Once re-rated the forklift should have a new factory authorized specification plate, to replace the original plate, installed showing the new rating for the lift.

<p>In trucks where the operator stands, a vertical clearance of at least 74 inches should be maintained from the platform where he stands to the underside of the section of the guard under which the operator's head moves during normal operation.

The optional light and fan package offers enhanced lighting on the operator's platform, allowing enhanced visibility when order picking.</p>
