Rentals are a repeat business - your customers only rent your equipment for a period of time, so if they need it again in the future they have to rent again.

It may well be that you already know exactly what you want, in which case we will provide you with a quote.</p>
<p>Here's a quick look at a few common hazards associated with forklifts. Often a large forklift load obstructs the driver's view in one direction.

Battery Operated Pallet Trucks are used to lift and move pallets.</p>
<p>Lifted trucks have a negative reputation for being unsafe, but that's simply untrue. This determines how heavy of a load the forklift can handle, and at what different heights. The LHM200SC pallet truck in the BT Lifter L-series is equipped with a scale to provide high-accuracy weighing during the material handling process. Lifted truck maintenance services require assessment of your brakes, shocks, wheels, as well as tires.</p>
