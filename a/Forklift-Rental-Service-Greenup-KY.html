<p>Here's a quick look at a few common hazards associated with forklifts. Often a large forklift load obstructs the driver's view in one direction.

Hand trucks lift the load a few inches off the ground, so they meant to be carrying things for long distances or extended periods.</p>
<p>Transmissions on forklifts, in particular, can be subject to abuse. When not used for picking, these trucks can also be used for the transport or stacking of pallets. With lift capacities of 5,000, 6,000 and 8,000 pounds, respectively, the three established G Series rough-terrain forklift models offered by Case can be equipped with two mast heights — 15 and 22 feet — to cover most applications.</p>

While the dealer insures the equipment, you'll want to make sure your company's insurance covers the operator, other people at your facility and the facility in the event of an injury or property damage when the rented forklift is in use.</p>
