<p>Many rough terrain forklifts come with either two-wheel drive or four-wheel drive options. And one of the biggest barriers to making your warehouse work for you is the forklifts you have at your disposal. Use: Most commonly used forklift in the U.S. Primarily used indoors in warehouse type operations, good for use on smooth surfaces only.
