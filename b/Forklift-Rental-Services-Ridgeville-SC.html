<p>A warehouse forklift can also carry weight that your human warehouse staff simply can't.

Each is designed to work within extreme environments, natural landscapes, and the uneven ground often found on construction sites.</p>
<p>For example, if what you are used to is an automatic car, test driving should not be the time for you to attempt driving a stick shift vehicle. The Toyota Order Picker easily maneuvers narrow aisles in warehouses with minimized rack impact during case picking thanks to optional wire guidance and double rail guidance systems. Industrial and powered pallet jacks in general weigh more than standard light-duty models.</p>

Flexible terms - if you have an increased workload and need another forklift urgently, we can rent you another one at the same rate you are currently paying.</p>
