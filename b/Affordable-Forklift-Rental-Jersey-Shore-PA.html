<p>A forklift is also known as a lift truck essentially because it's a truck that can lift loads using a set of forks. Telehandlers look and function like forklifts, but have a telescopic boom that can extend forwards and upwards for different attachments, such as a bucket, pallet forks, or muck grab. If the forklift truck in front is driving too slow. Handling processes will be slowed down, the equipment will experience increased wear and tear, and it may even suffer serious damage under excessive loads.</p>
<p>Here's a quick look at a few common hazards associated with forklifts. Often a large forklift load obstructs the driver's view in one direction. Apart from this, these rental services are rendered according to the client's demands. They work better than 4-wheel forklifts where space is limited. This product range is capable of moving the heavy loads very easily and for the packing goods in warehouses, stores and factories.</p>

IN June, 1946, The American Society of Mechanical Engineers adopted a resolution to develop a safety code on powered industrial trucks.</p>
<p>Warning: An overhead guard is intended to offer protection from the impact of small packages, boxes, bagged material, etc., representative of the job application, but not to withstand the impact of a falling capacity load.
