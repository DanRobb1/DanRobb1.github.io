An overhead guard is intended to offer protection from the impact of small packages, boxes, bagged material, etc., representative of the job application, but not to withstand the impact of a falling capacity load. Two lifting-fork order pickers allow the operator to vary the load height to reduce the need for reaching and bending.</p>
<p>At Laura Buick GMC, we are the best lifted truck dealership near St Louis. So if you need additional materials handling equipment to keep your business up and running, we can help. A 2000kg load can be sufficiently moved with some effort; however, with poor ground, a poor quality pallet jack, unstable loads, slopes, etc., it will be much more difficult for the pallet jack worker.</p>

Theoretically this is to increase off-road performance, although the higher center of gravity would likely make them more likely to roll over on rough terrain.</p>
<p>But palletisation really enhances the material handling efficiency and throughput. These powerful machines can handle very heavy loads and operate on all kinds of difficult terrain.
