<p>Powerful performance meets compact design. Trucks with a body lift often have a visible gap between the frame and body, which a lot of people find unsightly. This is due to the fact that a used forklift really has no suspension and it is not possible to maintain tire to ground contact in uneven environments. These fees are based on the length of the time you have your rental. The hand pallet truck lift offers load shifting, lifting and lowering functions.</p>
<p>At Granite Industrial, we stand by all of the products we sell and offer a variety of Preventitative Maintenance services. Designed for both indoor and outdoor applications, electric and internal combustion engine tractors have weight capacities of between 3,000 lbs.
