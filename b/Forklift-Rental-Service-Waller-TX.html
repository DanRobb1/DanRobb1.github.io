This is achieved by two outer legs which distribute the load weight and prevent the forklift from tipping. This type of lift is more expensive than a body lift and requires making changes to the mechanical system or suspension of the truck. The walkie stacker has a subtype: the order picker forklift.</p>
<p>Due to this reason, we work hard to offer some cheap used lifted trucks for sale. Body lift kits are also typically the least expensive option when looking to lift a truck; however, a gap is created by the spacer between the body and frame. Today, rough terrain forklifts are some of the most versatile machines you'll find on a job site. The Raymond 9800 pallet truck is the ultimate very narrow aisle lift truck.</p>
