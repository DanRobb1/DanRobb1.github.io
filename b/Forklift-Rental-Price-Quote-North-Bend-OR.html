In such scenarios, Forklift Trucks play an important role in the food and beverage industry.</p>
<p>I found the right forklift on Damoli's website and just ordered it over the phone. So this is not the same type of lift as a body lift kit. Class I vehicles include three-wheel electric sit-down trucks; and high- and low-platform sit-down rider type trucks with cushion tires or pneumatic tires. 123Forklift makes it easy to compare forklift prices, service plans and warranties on all used forklifts.</p>
