I am not an expert on lift kits, but based on my personal observation, they offer sizes like "six inches," or "eight inches," or "tall enough to provide storm shelter for a herd of Black Rhinoceros." That one's a big seller here in the South.</p>

It is at this point of rebound that big lifted trucks are likely to crash or flip, because it can be difficult to control the bouncing.
