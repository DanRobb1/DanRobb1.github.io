<p>Gray Manufacturing has produced the highest quality jacks and lifting products for over 60 years. We provide UniCarriers Forklifts including stand up and sit down trucks from 3,000 to 15,500 lb. They have the ability to reach loads that sit up high and can extend to distances beyond their stabilising legs. Compared to a forklift, these machines have a smaller capacity. Drivers should know the capacity of the machine to prevent tipping due to overly heavy or improperly balanced loads.</p>
<p>Forklifts and lift trucks are an essential part of most construction projects and carry their own set of hazards depending on the vehicle type and the workplace where the truck is used. Toyota Material Handling Term Rental System delivers operating costs on an annual basis, simplifying budgeting and cost control. This forklift line has four pneumatic tires, making it better for warehouse use.</p>

The maximum allowable load should be clearly marked on the nameplate of the forklift truck.</p>
<p>While most standard forklifts can reach between 10 and 15 feet, a telehandler can lift to heights of 55 feet.

<p>Whether you're considering a lifted truck for work, pleasure, or both, there are some important benefits to think about as you get ready to decide what your next vehicle purchase should be.
