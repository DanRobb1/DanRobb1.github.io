According to the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), the counterbalance load distribution are involved in falling load accidents more frequently than other types of powered industrial trucks.</p>
<p>Pallet trucks should be durable, not disposable. More custom shops are toying around with lengthened trucks on custom chassis or even military truck chassis to create one-of-a-kind builds that get rubber-necked more than a 10-car pileup. Therefore, a fork lift operator must be able to use the machine to fit large, heavy pallets into relatively small areas, such as large shelving fixtures.</p>
