Crazy lift kits and cab stretching isn't just for light duty trucks.

A pallet jack, also known as a pallet truck, 1 pallet pump, pump truck, scooter, dog, 1 or jigger 1 is a tool used to lift and move pallets Pallet jacks are the most basic form of a forklift 2 and are intended to move pallets within a warehouse.</p>
