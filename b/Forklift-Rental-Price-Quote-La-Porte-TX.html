<p>Toyota Forklift is proud to have the biggest range of forklifts and battery-electric warehouse equipment available in South-Africa, ensuring that whatever your requirements we have a suitable material handling solution.

Dayton® pallet trucks feature a cushion grip with a 3-position lever and a flow valve for controlled lowering.</p>

Rather than installing between the body and frame, these kits are used to physically increase the height of the suspension for the pickup, which raises the body and frame.</p>
