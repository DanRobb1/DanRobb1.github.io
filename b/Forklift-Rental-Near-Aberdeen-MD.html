By decreasing the air pressure, the driver can decrease the weight-carrying capacity of the axle or eliminate it completely by raising it up and off of the road. Our used lifted trucks are durable, capable, and ready to handle any of the local trails and provide you the added power in any driving situation.</p>
<p>As well as Materials Handling equipment - covering London, Heathrow, Gatwick and surrounding areas. The thrill of navigating rough and rocky terrain can only be accomplished in a truck that has the right amount of ground clearance and larger tires.

For trucks with tilting masts, the mast should be vertical as defined in Test # OP1 or at full rearward tilt, whichever is less stable.
