By decreasing the air pressure, the driver can decrease the weight-carrying capacity of the axle or eliminate it completely by raising it up and off of the road. Our used lifted trucks are durable, capable, and ready to handle any of the local trails and provide you the added power in any driving situation.</p>
<p>As well as Materials Handling equipment - covering London, Heathrow, Gatwick and surrounding areas. The thrill of navigating rough and rocky terrain can only be accomplished in a truck that has the right amount of ground clearance and larger tires. These types of forklifts are all hand controlled where the operator is in the front of the truck and controls the lift truck through a steering tiller.</p>
<p>Additionally, if you're towing a heavy load, a lifted suspension provides the benefit of having more room to settle before the weight of the load bottoms out. For trucks with tilting masts, the mast should be vertical as defined in Test # OP1 or at full rearward tilt, whichever is less stable. The new Toyota high capacity reach forklifts are developed for intensive stacking applications focusing on productivity, reliability, ergonomics (controls, steering and seat adapted to the driver's needs) and most importantly safety.</p>
