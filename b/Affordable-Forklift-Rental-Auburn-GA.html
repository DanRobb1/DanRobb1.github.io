Whether you need to move heavy loads in a warehouse or construction field, forklifts can safely lift objects humans cannot, making them indispensable on any job site. Standard 1910.178 covers all aspects of forklift operator training, from fuel handling and charging batteries to truck operation and maintenance.</p>
<p>The low step-in height, easy trailer connection and simple battery change make these trucks very user-friendly.
