<p>Not ready to buy new but need a material handling solution right away we have a good selection of used material handling equipment to choose from on a regular basis.

Courtesy Chevrolet does our lifted trucks in house so you know you are getting a great deal and a quality job done.</p>

The Industrial Duty Pallet Jack is great for small spaces, and handles easily.

Rough terrain forklifts provide a high degree of mobility and safety as well as access to areas that would otherwise be off limits.

Inside, vehicle-specific valving and a nitrogen-charged monotube body work together to provide a smooth ride, even with oversized tires.</p>
