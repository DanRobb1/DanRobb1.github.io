<p>Raymond 4000 Series sit down forklifts provide the visibility needed to maximize operator confidence, and minimize damage to racks, products, and facilities. It's the grandchild of the C5000 series, one of the most beloved forklifts ever made. Not all forklifts work the same, and many come equipped with different features. These forklifts can drive under 8 foot passages, and come in two-wheel, four-wheel, and four-wheel crab steering (all wheels are able to turn).</p>
<p>The load limit is shown on the data plate of the lift truck. Monster street truck drivers are at the distinct disadvantage in close quarters when maneuvering, such as in stop-and-go driving, city traffic, and even parking. Consideration should be given to reducing tilt speeds on trucks with extra high lift. Reach forklifts can operate in aisles as narrow as 2.4 meters, as opposed to the counterbalance's minimum requirement of 3.7 meters.</p>
