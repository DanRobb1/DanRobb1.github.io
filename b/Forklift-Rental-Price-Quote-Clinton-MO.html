Pallet trucks are used for unloading and stuffing goods that are delivered on the pallet such as cartons and tinned goods.</p>

The test load should be equivalent to an unrestrained, homogeneous cube, the dimensions of which are twice the rated load center dimension, and should equal in weight to the rated capacity of the truck. Similar to a reach truck, the electric variety is only for indoor use.</p>

<p>Straddle trucks have longer forks than stand-up trucks and are used to carry long materials such as pipes, boards, and trees. To enable easy movement, the trucked equipped with 200 mm diameter, UHMW-PE steer wheels and UHMW-PE load rollers.
