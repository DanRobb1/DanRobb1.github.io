<p>A forklift is also known as a lift truck essentially because it's a truck that can lift loads using a set of forks. Telehandlers look and function like forklifts, but have a telescopic boom that can extend forwards and upwards for different attachments, such as a bucket, pallet forks, or muck grab. If the forklift truck in front is driving too slow. Handling processes will be slowed down, the equipment will experience increased wear and tear, and it may even suffer serious damage under excessive loads.</p>
<p>Lift Capacity: 12000 lbs. The Raymond 5000 Series order pickers deliver exceptional versatility, intuitive handling and easy maintenance. Experience proves that operators who are properly trained, keep within the forklift's load capacity, and follow rules of safe operation avoid tipovers and accidents. Forklift training has many names, such as forklift licensing or forklift certification.</p>
