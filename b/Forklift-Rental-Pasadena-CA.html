<p>This because a forklift's lifting capacity is affected by the dimensions of the load (especially load length), the lifting height, and the attachments used. The operator should never use the forklift as a personal lift unless wearing the proper harness and safety equipment.

Raising your truck can help making towing easier, as the increased ground clearance makes loading and unloading more accessible.</p>
