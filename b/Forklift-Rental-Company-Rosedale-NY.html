These changes can actually improve the handling of a pickup, however, and there is no limit, beyond a practical one, to how much lift this kind of kit can give a truck. Whether you have seasonal business, a temporary increase in workload, or are taking on a special project with a definite endpoint, leasing a forklift is probably the way to go. And the money you save by leasing can be put into what matter most: growing the business.</p>
