<p>Largely intended for safety during forward reach operation, they prevent rollovers by elevating the front tires off the ground and counterbalancing the extra weight. Their upfront price is the inverse of electric, making IC forklifts initially cheaper than electric models, but they cost more per hour to run. At Durante Rentals, we rent forklifts and telehandlers for all your material handling needs.</p>
<p>Trucks employing a horizontal (vertical axis) handwheel have been built with directional-reverse steer (i.e. a control that causes a truck to turn to the operator's right on clockwise rotation of the steering handwheel when the operator is facing away from the direction of normal forward travel.) For this reason directional-reverse steer is permissible for this type of truck.</p>
<p>Apart from the manufacturers, various truck associations are also participating in taking necessary initiatives that can help to enhance the productivity and safety concerns of the lift trucks operations. Call us for forklift service, forklift sales, or forklift repairs. Cat lift trucks are manufactured and distributed by Mitsubishi Caterpillar Forklift America Inc.</p>
