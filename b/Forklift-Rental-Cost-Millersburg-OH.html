<p>We have a large inventory of forklifts for rent. Order pickers offer intuitive controls and features - like ergonomic control handles, panoramic views, low step heights and padded platforms - that help operators do more with less effort. Four-wheel-drive, also known as 4×4, is the hallmark of a vehicle built for off-road performance and on-road safety, and it has also become synonymous with the Jeep brand.</p>
<p>Truck should be placed on an initially level test platform in a position that the center line of the truck is per-perpendicular the axis of tilting of the test platform, and with the rear wheels placed in their least stable position. The wheels on most lifted trucks are quite a bit larger than those on standard-sized trucks. More importantly, we provide every one of the products and services that you require to oversee and care for your fork lifts.</p>
<p>A-brand forklift trucks are offered such as Kalmar, Hyster, Terex, SMV, Svetruck, Caterpillar, Linde, BT Toyota, TCM, Komatsu, Yale, Nissan, Mitsubishi and other brands.

<p>With Crown's Stability Stance, operators have four points of solid contact with the lift truck when stopping and starting from 9 metres in the air. Like a rental car, if you were to need insurance coverage, then this could be another $50 to $150+ per day and would only cover the truck. This is because the forks are mounted to the side of the truck and can pick up wide or long loads that would be awkward or inaccessible with a straight forward forklift.</p>
