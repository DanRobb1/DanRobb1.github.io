<p>A lift kit can have a serious impact on your off-road driving. Additionally, buying your forklifts allows your drivers to get used to one vehicle, rather than learning how to use different trucks every few weeks or months. A walk-behind narrow aisle lift truck with a 3,000 to 4,000 pound capacity costs approximately $15,000 to $18,000. Lifted trucks with a body lift have physical spacers or blocks installed between the body and the frame of the truck.</p>
