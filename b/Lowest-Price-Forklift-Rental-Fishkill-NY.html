We specialize in new and used warehouse forklifts to include narrow aisle reach trucks, pneumatic tire and cushion tire forklifts , order pickers and electric and manual pallet jacks. IN June, 1946, The American Society of Mechanical Engineers adopted a resolution to develop a safety code on powered industrial trucks.</p>

Like the pallets themselves, pallet jacks have become a lot more standardized in North America as of late. Southeast Forklifts specializes in high quality, thoroughly inspected and reconditioned equipment you can trust. From the moment you first step into the reception area, decorated with handmade up-cycled furniture built from old pallets to the large warehouse space where the forklifts, order pickers, boom, and scissor lifts all operate, we have made a huge effort for the whole place to be a positive, professional, clean, modern and friendly environment.</p>
<h2>Pallet Lift Fishkill</h2>
<p>Forklifts can actually be traced back to the late 1800's, but the modern forklift was developed in the 1960s by various companies including the transmission manufacturing company Clark and the hoist company Yale & Towne Manufacturing. This counterbalance (whether it's an actual weight or the forklift batteries found in an electric lift) is what offsets the load in front, accommodating weights from 3,000 to 120,000 lbs depending on the model selected.</p>
<p>Step into the forklift operator's seat and fasten the seatbelt. From the wide-open operator window to its rock solid stability system, Crown's SP Series forklifts are designed to help busy order pickers maintain confidence at height and efficiently handle a variety of tasks. As the name suggests, the reach forklift is primarily designed to pick up loads high in racking or storage.</p>

Most kits include a standard or heavy duty compressor, a controller and all the hardware that you need to install the compressor onto your vehicle. This means that they are perfect for transporting heavy loads across rugged terrain, with some models handling up to 3 tonnes per load.</p>
