Any attachment on a forklift will reduce its nominal load rating, which is computed with a stock fork carriage and forks. Battery electric forklifts, powered by lead-acid batteries or, increasingly, lithium-ion batteries, include: cushion tire forklifts, scissor lifts, order pickers, stackers, reach trucks and pallet jacks.</p>

Depending on the quality of your shocks, you'll likely enjoy more control of your vehicle and higher ground clearance as well.

<h3>New Forklift Trucks Somerville AL</h3>
<p>When you're buying a new forklift or pallet loader, you can discuss trading in your old material handling equipment with the sales professionals from Mid-Ohio Forklifts, Inc. Large tires and elevated suspension equal higher ground clearance and mean these trucks are better able to handle all kinds of road conditions. Counterbalanced Stackers contain no outriggers and loads (1,500 - 4,000 lbs) are counterbalanced using the overall length of the unit, plus battery weight.</p>
<p>This allows the reach truck to place pallets of products into shelving. All forklift operators should be certified and keep their training up to date, for their safety and that of those around them. With solutions for indoor and outdoor operations, warehouse and distribution centers to rugged terrain applications, we have the right forklift for your business when you need it.</p>
<p>The second type is a body lift kit, which raises your truck between one and three inches and allows you to keep your standard tires while giving them a wider margin from the body. The reach forklift also features low under-carriage clearance and so we recommend that, prior to purchasing, you survey when the truck would be in operation. The warehouses owned by the companies will be shifting towards mechanization through Pallet trucks and integrate with warehouse management systems to handle complex environments of future.</p>
